Inspired by Jakub Jedryszek on his post [“Why Programmers Should Have a Blog"](http://architects.dzone.com/articles/why-programmers-should-have), I decided to start write down somethings, and if you are a programmer, you should start too.

So, if you start blogging you have a lot of options on the category “content management system” (CMS) to post your insights.
[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) and [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) are the most popular, but wait a little bit until go deep on one these options.

Get some minutes to try [JekyII](http://jekyllrb.com/) and as the original site says:

> "Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs."

And you really need some minutes to do that. So I'll describe some reasons that you should start or migrate to JekyII instead of other options.

#### Here are some reasons:
1. **Markdown**
	- All your posts are written in plain text with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
2. **In the version control**
	- You can keep everything on version control, what it's really nice, because you can track everything.
	Another thing on this terms is about [The Twelve Factors](http://12factor.net/), the first factor is about codebase, and as a programmer you really like to keep your stuffs in a revision control and we can say that we have a "blog as a code"...
3. **Free hosting on Github**
	- Yes, you can host your website/blog on Github for free.
	- Here are 3 steps on how to do that: http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html
	- Or here: https://pages.github.com/
4. **Performance**
	- Here is described better than I can explain: http://nilclass.com/courses/what-is-a-static-website/
5. **Extendable**
	- JekyII is written in Ruby, so you can extend it as you want.
6. **Customisable**
	- You can use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) as framework to keep it fashion and fancy or write your own css and html pages with the layout that you think is better.
7. **Less concerns**
	- This is the point that I like more, less is more. Less database to take care, less cache to take care, less hosting and monthly payment to take care.
	- It's simple.
8. **Plugins**
	- You have thousands of plugins available and if you don't find one that you need, just create a new one and share it with the community.
	- You can write plugin in Ruby and you just need to add them on your repository.
9. **Continuous Integration**
	- You can test your blog build against Ruby versions with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/): http://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/

Start blogging and enjoy it!
